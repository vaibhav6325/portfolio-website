        <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely underthe control of real estate developers. Construction activities have resulted in aclouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency isregulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Courtbattles over recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents,especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>
        <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmentalwatchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build afour-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay) wasproposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects andenvironmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsible and diversified useof the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.</p>

        <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has beenmeasuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of theLTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary tosupport science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. TheLTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies withinterests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired dataon urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water QualityControl Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the fluxof nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>
        <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis TahoeEnvironmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and public outreach,and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable useof the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake"assessment report.</p>
